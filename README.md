## Validations 

### Email Validation
- Pattern: ^[^ ]+@[^ ]+\.[a-z]{2,3}$

- Description: Validates that the input adheres to a standard email format.

### Password Validation

- Pattern: ^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$

- Description: Ensures that the password:
- Contains at least one lowercase letter
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Contains at least one digit
- Contains at least one special character from [@, $, !, %, *, ?, or &]
- Is at least 8 characters long

### Hide and Show Password
- The application provides an option to hide/show the password input text.

### Confirm Password Validation
- This project does not currently implement confirm password validation, but you can extend the existing pattern for this purpose.
- These validations are integrated into the project by associating the validation functions with relevant form events such as form submission and keyup events for real-time feedback to the user.
